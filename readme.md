Database of maps I'm organizing, logging, and creating for Multi Theft Auto: San Andreas.  

The place is a mess. The structure makes sense to myself, but probably not to others. But you're probably here for something specific.  

That likely is going to be...  

# Super FleischBerg Autos  
*The FleischBergÂ© CEO is threatening to fire you from your job at the brewery! Luckily for you, she is a vehicle aficionado and she is throwing a birthday party at your workplace soon! Collect all the vehicles before the party is over to impress her and maybe keep your job!*  

A race where all 212 vehicles in the game have been given a fixed spawn location, and must all be driven to a single delivery point at the center of the map. Players will all eventually deliver all the same vehicles from the same locations, making it fair, but the order in which each vehicle is done is randomized.  
Options exist to only do 5, 10, or 30 vehicles, as the full experience takes somewhere around 7 hours.
