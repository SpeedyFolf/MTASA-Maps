DONE - You can squeeze throug hthe sub_gate and the orange barrier above the Dune area
DONE - The gate by the Dune is blocking the DUne's path
DONE - The test spawnpoint at the Andromade still exists
DONE - move checkpointsi n between the two DFTs maybe a bit further up the ramp?
DONE - Extend the diagonal placed walls in the DFT area so you don't get stuck on them.
DONE - DFT is escapable perhaps
DONE - Add a speedbump to guide helpers towards the yankee as they come off the thing
DONE - Improve flow of helper vehicles
DONE - checkpoint 26 and 27 can be gotten b ygrinding the wall adn goign back
DONE - Add a diagonal wall so you can just reverse the yankee out
DONE - Smooth all the sharp edges
DONE - Place a repair in the middle of the last DFT's carry path
DONE - Fix Super GT falling through its floor
DONE - Dumper can get out by driving over the orange fence by the blue pole
DONE - Make the zigzaggy bit before Dune a little less obnoxious
DONE - Players get stuck on the first bus, move that platform. Seems especially bad when reversing in.
DONE - Fence for riders so they can only get at the Andromada tail at the right spot
Some arrows might help fix the most basic of issues
DONE - Place repair by first DFT
DONE - Align the andromada a bit more left
DONE - Gates turns wrong way
DONE - Place arrow under shortcut
DONE - Last DFT needs repair
Course abandoned message, abort after finish
DONE - Mid-DFT cp''s even further
DONE - More tug markers at dumper
smooth inner corner of first bus
DONE - extend the leave zone a bit in front of the first bus onto the road
move penultimate checkpoint bit more right
