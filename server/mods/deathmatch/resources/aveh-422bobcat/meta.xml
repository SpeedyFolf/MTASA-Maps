    <info gamemodes="race" type="map" name="Funny Curry - The Aftermath 2" author="LotsOfS" version="1.0.0" description="When the last time the curry you had for lunch tasted a bit funny, you thought it caused you to hallucinate a nutjob trying to rig the dam with explosives. Only it wasn&apos;t a hallucination, and the boss nearly fired you. Today, you had curry again. Lo&apos; and behold: Another nutjob showed up. This time you&apos;re not risking it though; hallucination or not, you neutralized the threat and dumped him in the back of your truck. Now dispose of the body.
	
Surprisingly fast and not too bad in the corners, if a little slippery, this vehicle and track combination make for an excellent beginner race.
