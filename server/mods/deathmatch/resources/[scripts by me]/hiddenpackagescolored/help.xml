Various Hidden Packages have been hidden around San Andreas, waiting for you to collect them. Can you collect them all?

For now, only the northwest of the state has packages hidden in it. More areas will be added soon.

~~~Colors~~~
The hidden packages come in various colors with different meanings:
White: Regular packages, accessible by most ground vehicles.
Blue: Water packages, accessible by boats only.
Orange: Sky packages, accessible by aircraft only.
Green: Narrow packages, accessible by bikes only.
Yellow: Difficult packages. These are harder to find or get to.
Red: Extreme packages. These are harder to find and get to.
Black: These are only available in specific races, set in customly built maps.

~~~Commands~~~
To help you look for packages, the following commands are available to enable/disable useful features:

/toggleRadar 
This will mark areas on the map, coloring them based on the amount of packages you've collected. A black area means you've found no packages there, a white area means you've found all of them, and anything in between. Areas that have not been colored do not have any packages in them.

/toggleBlips
This will show blips on your map for each package you've already found.

/toggleUI
This will display a panel with statistics on your collected packages, helping you keep track of how many you've already found.

/togglePackages
In case you wish to opt out of the Hidden Package hunting program, you may disable them using this command. They won't show up for you anymore.

/resetPackages
This will reset your progress of collected packages to 0. Warning: there will be no confirmation prompt, and this can't be undone. Use with caution.

Pro-tip: You can bind the above commands to a key using /bind

Happy Searching! :)
