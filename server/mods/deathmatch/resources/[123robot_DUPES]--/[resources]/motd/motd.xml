<motd version="42" lastChanged="2024-05-01 17:30:00">Welcome to the GTA Speedrunners&apos; Server! (created and sponsored by Joshimuz, ran by 123robot with assistance from Parik and LotsOfS) This is a revival of a community Racing/Destruction Derby/Minigame server from 2013.&#x0A;&#x0A;FOR HELP PRESS F9 to bring up the help menu, which explains all the addons.&#x0A;FPS is 30 so that physics are near identical to those in speedruns AND IT WILL NOT BE CHANGED.&#x0A;If you have a map you want added, contact 123robot. REMEMBER, always use ghost mode on, respawn time 1 second, and 1 spawn point for races unless otherwise required.&#x0A;Please use the /rate command to rate maps, low rated maps will be considered for removal.&#x0A;&#x0A;You can donate to help support the running of the server through StreamLabs (but of course only if you&apos;re able) at the following donation link: https://streamlabs.com/123robot&#x0A;&#x0A;RULES AND GUIDELINES:&#x0A;&#x0A;Basic guidelines of conduct for the server. We want to make it clear precisely what and will not be tolerated on the server.&#x0A;&#x0A;1) Don&apos;t spam the chat with lots of useless and unnecessary messages.&#x0A;2) Avoid language intended to shock, offend, or otherwise provoke, particularly hate speech and discriminatory language.&#x0A;3) Do not harass or insult other players needlessly - we want to maintain a friendly atmosphere.&#x0A;&#x0A;Consistent rule-breaking can result in anything from a mute to a total ban, so keep that in mind. Just try and act sensibly and you shouldn&apos;t have to worry about this.&#x0A;I encourage you to use the /report feature and select &apos;Player Complaints&apos; for anyone who is breaking these guidelines or causing problems.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~01/05/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Robot is still away, so it&apos;s me again. While I am in charge of this MOTD, I will go ahead and experiment a little with the order and format of the detailed update log, see what makes the most sense. This update includes some new maps, some minor updates, and an update that might be useful to some of you that create more exotic maps. Some of the new maps/map updates came in just before the previous update went out so I wasn&apos;t able to get them done in time; I thank you for your patience! -LotsOfS&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;&quot;[R] Draft Dodger Patriot&quot; by Gberry, a map to teach you the most optimal Patriot route for Import/Export!&#x0A;&quot;[R] Dyna-Loop Randomiser&quot; by Mawfeen, an off-road/quarry-suitable randomiser race.&#x0A;&quot;[R] Dyna-Loop Randomiser (Collisions)&quot; by Mawfeen, an off-road/quarry-suitable randomiser race with collisions.&#x0A;&quot;[R] Fort Carson Fun Course Randomiser&quot; by Mawfeen, a pickup/pickup-like/suv randomiser race.&#x0A;&quot;[SR] Export Patriot from Easter Bay Chemicals&quot; by R*/Gberry, a map to teach you the most optimal no wanted level Patriot route for the Import/Export!&#x0A;&quot;&quot; by &#x0A;&quot;&quot; by &#x0A;&quot;&quot; by &#x0A;&quot;&quot; by &#x0A;&#x0A;GENERAL UPDATES:&#x0A;- Car colors broke entirely in the previous update. This should now be resolved.&#x0A;- Fixed an issue where typing /hide 0 after using /hide 2 would not correctly restore every player&apos;s visibility.&#x0A;- The race progress bar &amp; race minimap now use the same algorithm for determining checkpoint order as the race gamemode itself, fixing issues where these would just not show up accurately whatsoever for races that had checkpoints out of order in their map file.&#x0A;- Fix a grammar error in the chat warning for maps with too few spawnpoints.&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP CREATORS:&#x0A;- You can now change the blip size of your checkpoints by adding a &quot;blipsize&quot; attribute to the checkpoint&apos;s node, and setting its value to an integer. &#x0A;- This is recommended for maps where the checkpoints are far away and bigger blips are desired so it&apos;s easier to find on the F11 map. For example: &quot;[R] Find Your Way&quot;. &#x0A;- Alternatively this is useful for checkpoints that are activated by script instead of hit normally. For example &quot;[R] Pack Mule&quot; has 100 checkpoints used to maintain some sense of logic in the progress bar and player ranking, which manifested themselves in the form of a black up-pointing triangle in the middle of the Los Santos bay.&#x0A;- Setting the blipsize to 0 will make it completely invisible. For reference: The default checkpoint blipsize is 2. The size of player blips and the upcoming checkpoint blip is 1. The size of the chased checkpoint blip in &quot;[R] Pack Mule&quot; is 4. &#x0A;- Keep in mind that this is a change that applies to this server only. Until we work out a way to get this feature approved into the official race gamemode, it is recommended that you continue to keep your scripty checkpoints tidy so your maps will also show up well in other and older versions of the race gamemode.&#x0A;&#x0A;HIDDEN PACKAGES:&#x0A;- Added black hidden packages to remaining eligible [R] maps that were added to the server before 14/03/2024&#x0A;- Chat output now colors the package type again&#x0A;- Red packages weren&apos;t counted for the total count of a specific region. Now they are.&#x0A;- Removed black packages from the totals count of the entire map.&#x0A;- Removed an inaccessible package on R-RandomLuck, and added a package to MG-TheRiddleOfTheSphinx in its stead.&#x0A;- Changed the debug messages to continue the investigation into why some players don&apos;t see black packages.&#x0A;&#x0A;UPDATED MAPS:&#x0A;[MG] Most Wanted: Los Santos:&#x0A;    - Now has a post-death pedestrian mode (go get those campers!), no animations as they are too desynched.&#x0A;    - A random gate on the highway has been removed.&#x0A;    - Job limit changed to 120 (criminals * 3 + 10)&#x0A;    - Exit limit changed to 10&#x0A;    - Remove invisible cop vehicles&#x0A;    - frac16; players are now cops, instead of frac19;.&#x0A;    - MP5 damage lowered from 25 to 20.&#x0A;    - Increase siren range to 200.&#x0A;    - The center of mass of cop cars has been lowered to reduce the number of cops dying to flipping their vehicle.&#x0A;    - There are now 3 locations for the crooked doctor. The nearest will be for the organ harvest job.&#x0A;    - The organ harvest job will now restore health (+50 per organ).&#x0A;    - Some additional values may be slightly altered for balance.&#x0A;[MG] Pack Mule:&#x0A;    - No longer displays a random black triangle in the Los Santos bay.&#x0A;[R] Find Your Way:&#x0A;    - Blip size of the final checkpoint on the F11 map &amp; radar has been increased to 5 (was 2).&#x0A;[R] Mafia Sentinel Struggle: &#x0A;    - Now has a description. &#x0A;    - Added one extra checkpoint to prevent people from using a tiny unintentional &quot;shortcut&quot;. &#x0A;    - Made it more obvious where to go.&#x0A;[R] Paramedic: San Andreas:&#x0A;    - Upon dying, you will respawn with an empty ambulance at the last hospital visited; # rescued patients will no longer be reset.&#x0A;    - Fixed an error message related to other people&apos;s timers.&#x0A;[R] San Andreas Randomizer (Collisions):&#x0A;    - Moved secret rhino to a locatio nwhere it cannot escape&#x0A;    - Add the Feltzer, Hustler, Tampa &amp; Bloodring Banger to the pool of vehicles.&#x0A;    - Increased respawn time to 5 seconds (was 1).&#x0A;    - A few other minor map tweaks.&#x0A;[R] Shanty 8-Track Randomiser:&#x0A;    - Fixed any collision issues related to scaled objects. This does not affect where you can go explore.&#x0A;    - Small additional decoration and visual changes such as properly aligning floors, houses, stilts, etc.&#x0A;[R] Shanty 8-Track Randomiser (Collisions):&#x0A;    - Fixed any collision issues related to scaled objects. This does not affect where you can go explore.&#x0A;    - Small additional decoration and visual changes such as properly aligning floors, houses, stilts, etc.&#x0A;[R] Vandomiser: &#x0A;    - Raised the guard rails so you don&apos;t just slide over them in certain vehicles.&#x0A;[R] Vandomiser (Collisions): &#x0A;    - Raised the guard rails so you don&apos;t just slide over them in certain vehicles.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Circle Of Death&quot; because it had severely insufficient spawnpoints.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~24/04/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Hi. 123Robot is away for a couple weeks so I&apos;ll take over writing the MOTD.

To be fair though, there&apos;s been a lot of work from the combined efforts of me, S, and Ali_Digitali behind the scenes to smooth out the player experience as much as possible, and the amount of changes is a signifier of how much work we&apos;ve done to achieve that. So I&apos;m very proud of everyone who is helping make the server better, including the many map creators who have contributed to this update! Strap in - this one will keep you going for a while. Which is good, because I have no idea when the next update will be after this one. So I&apos;m pleased to be able to provide as much content as possible in this update to hopefully last for a while.&#x0A;&#x0A;If you somehow have the patience to read through every single line of this changelog, I salute you.&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Pack Mule&quot; by LotsOfS - A map dedicated to the Mule&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] King of the Hill &quot; by HumanTraffiC - Fight other players to stay at the top and become king of the hill!&#x0A;- &quot;[R] 2016 - Element D &quot; by Andreqw[LT]&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Adhesion &quot; by MSD&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Admiral LV &quot; by Shaky&#x0A;- &quot;[R] ALC 41 Seconds &quot; by EnyNight*&#x0A;- &quot;[R] ALC Don&apos;t give up!&quot; by EnyNight*&#x0A;- &quot;[R] A Quick Race For Good Fortune&quot; by misterfolg&#x0A;- &quot;[R] BADlands BLASTAround&quot; by BLASTAxerox&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Beach Disaster&quot; by LotsOfS - A map dedicated to the Ambulance&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Boring Sultan&quot; by éAdrien.H&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Cannonball&quot; by MSD&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Convoy Trucking&quot; by [DRuG]Stijger&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Docki Strade Di Campagna&quot; by Dockinoke&#x0A;- &quot;[R] FCR 900 Run&quot; by concurred&#x0A;- &quot;[R] FDP Midnight Run 1&quot; by MSD&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Nascar Stadium 2 - Derby Edition&quot; by Mark01 with some edits by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Night Casinos&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Packages Race&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] PoliceGT&quot; by Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Raceway Yoshi&quot; by Mr Shift&#x0A;- &quot;[R] SKC Comet Sunrise&quot; by Cortez&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sputs Bone County Romp&quot; by Sputs|uk&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sputs Grasshopper&quot; by Sputs|uk&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sputs Infernus Street Series 1&quot; by Sputs|uk&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sputs Random Romp&quot; by Sputs|uk&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Trainstation to Trainstation&quot; by LotsOfS - A map dedicated to the Cheetah&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Vandomiser&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Vandomiser (Collisions)&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;&#x0A;UPDATED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Battle Deluxe&quot; now specifies that you need to be parked in order to heal, and now has a description.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Jump Around Jump -II-&quot; duplicate spawns removed.&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Most Wanted: Los Santos&quot; balancing changes, plus an extra job!&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Shark Attack&quot; renamed.

It will also now scale its width if there are long map names present.&#x0A;- Various fixes to do with colored nametags showing up incorrectly in the scoreboard, player nametags, and /me command&#x0A;- Players will no longer be pinkified when you are already coloured as part of a team, such as in TW maps.&#x0A;- Orange you glad you&apos;re reading this????&#x0A;&#x0A;HIDDEN PACKAGES:&#x0A;- Packages in Liberty City (or any other &apos;interiors&apos;) are now visible.&#x0A;- Added black hidden packages to eligible [R] maps starting with letters O through S added to the server before 14/03/2024&#x0A;- Fix a black hidden package in &quot;[R] NEOSPUGTOPIA&quot; that had a typo in its coordinates, and moved one package completely elsewhere as it got blocked off in a map update.&#x0A;- A black hidden package in &quot;[R] Hold W Randomiser&quot; was so far out from the default world its hitbox was doing floating point imprecision things. Did a hack so now it should be collectable. &#x0A;&#x0A;~~~13/04/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Mostly behind the scenes fixes this time that address issues related to large number of players, so next time Joshimuz is playing he and everyone else can enjoy a smooth experience. How nice. There are a few new maps though so you&apos;ve got a bit of everything!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] The Grand Olympic Jump&quot; Scripted by Ali_Digitali, Map by Rikishi&#x0A;- &quot;[R] LS Fortune&quot; by assfasda&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Mesela Yani&quot; by assfasda&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Military - Bayside&quot; by EpicDuckyMan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sabre Turbo Race 2&quot; by Awesom3 with Edits by Misterfolg&#x0A;&#x0A;UPDATED MAPS:&#x0A;- A large majority of Destruction Derby maps now support 128 players! So next time that big streamer whose name is in the title of the server is playing, he won&apos;t have to skip every DD map! Hooray! The remaining low player count maps will be sorted in future updates. S has helpfully assisted in listing all of the maps changed below if you want to read every single one.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] 3Bit Hit: The Desert&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 102 (was 65)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] 6+1 Towers&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 131 (was 58)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] A Wise Man From The East&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 71)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Actual Derby&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Alot&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 130 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Battle Deluxe&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 67)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Bobcat Madness&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Car Game&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 177 (was 65)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Catapult&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 171 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Die Another Day&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 142 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Disco Derby 3D&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 129 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] For Want Of Solid Ground&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Infernus Showdown: Blast Arena&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 65)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Infernus Showdown: SF Airport&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Infernus Showdown: The Farm&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 129 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Infernus Showdown: The Mall&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 76)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Infernus Showdown: The Quarry&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Jump Around Jump -II-&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 25)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Jump Towers&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Just a Derby&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Kamikaze&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 25)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Kappa Towers&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Leap Towers&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Looney Toons&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Monster Derby&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 64)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] NEIN Towers&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 128 (was 32)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Randomizer Derby 2&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 135 (was 66)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Shark Attack&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 131 (was 71)&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Snake Farm&quot; has had additional spawnpoints added for a total of 127 (was 65)&#x0A;&#x0A;- Below this point follows other map updates unrelated to player counts:&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] The Legendary Cash Hunt&quot; has fixed the bug that allowed you to complete the map instantly. As a result, map times and ratings have been reset. Also hides other player&apos;s blips so you can&apos;t see where they finish and instantly teleports you to the checkpoint upon completion.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Knights Tour&quot; has had its arena layout updated to make it more obvious where to go.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Rooftop Jumps&quot; was broken and failed to load on server boot. The bug is fixed and the map is now in the pool again.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sabre Turbo Race&quot; has been edited by misterfolg to use the correct engine sound and modified handling. Map times have been reset.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Super Fleischbergcopysr; Autos&quot; removed the Extended and Classic options from the voting as these options made the map take up way too much time.&#x0A;&#x0A;RACE GAMEMODE:&#x0A;- Fix capitalization issues on traveling screen.&#x0A;- Info in the bottom left now gets set correctly when such info is missing from the current map&apos;s metadata.&#x0A;- Rudimentary attempt at fixing collisions with faux on-foot players when player count is high.&#x0A;- The erratic spectate target selection behavior is having S stumped. He added some BTS debug console prints so he can do some field monitoring. Hopefully spectating will work as intended soon.&#x0A;- Fix a bug where your ghost would not show up at all if you had the top time, but no local copy of your ghost.&#x0A;&#x0A;HIDDEN PACKAGES:&#x0A;- Adjusted two hidden packages in Restricted Area and one package in El Quebrados because their hitbuces were sticking out through walls or floors.&#x0A;- Fix player progress reset when the resource is (re)started while the player is already present.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~11/04/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Guys, you&apos;re all sending in so many maps, I can barely keep up! Huge thanks to Redopter, WordofWind, and Mawfeen for the maps they sent in for this update - it&apos;s clear that a lot of work went into all of them and I want that to be recognised. I am eternally grateful to anyone who sends in what they&apos;ve made - I always appreciate the hard work people put into their maps! So I hope you all really enjoy them!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Jump Around Jump -II-&quot; by Zino&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Kamikaze&quot; by Tobster&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Mystery Towers&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Most Wanted: Los Santoscopysr; Autos&quot; by Big Pig&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] The Legendary Cash Hunt&quot; by WordofWind&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Badlands -- Chiliad&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Check Out&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Come Back Home, Catalina!&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Countryside Circuit&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Desert Drift&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Extra Weapons&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Finding Bigfoot&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Finding Cult Epsilon&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Finding Piggsy&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Nascar Stadium 2&quot; by Mark01 (with some edits by Mawfeen)&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Nascar Stadium 2 Randomiser&quot; by Mark01 (with some edits by Mawfeen)&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Normal Day in San Fierro Airport&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Pizza Quest&quot; by Redopter&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Birdseye Winder&quot; by Rockstar Games (ported by Redopter)&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Cobra Run&quot; by Rockstar Games (ported by Redopter)&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Scotch Bonnet Yellow Route&quot; by Rockstar Games (ported by Redopter)&#x0A;&#x0A;UPDATED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;Super Fleischberg Autos&quot; now uses the correct amount of overtime once a player finishes. Also, the Full Experience option has been removed until the next full event.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Hold W Randomizer&quot; has been shortened by 4 checkpoints. Additionally, the duration has been increased and the randomization script improved.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Shanty 8-Track Randomiser (Collisions)&quot; has had parts of the track smoothed out, a bustling sea life added, an adjusted 1st checkpoint to look better on the minimap, and spawns increased to 100. Improved randomisation script.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Shanty 8-Track Randomiser&quot; has all of the same changes as the collision version, except with less spawns to be more fair.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Delivery for Woozie&quot; had missing [R] added to name.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Race&quot; improved randomization script.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Race 2&quot; improved randomization script.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Race 3&quot; improved randomization script.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Race: Reroll Edition&quot; improved randomization script.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Oval Race&quot; improved randomization script.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Supersonic&quot; will now correctly randomize vehicles for all players. Also fixed bug preventing music from playing when enabled.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] BEYBLADOPHRENIA II&quot; will now correctly randomize vehicles for all players.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Multi Destruction Derby&quot; for being too easy to camp on the upper and lower areas (and therefore people can get stuck underneath the main platform without being able to reach others). Also had no incentive for movement.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~06/04/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Happy Birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear LotsOfS, happy birthday to you!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Pine -- SF&quot; by EpicDuckyMan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Recruitment Drive-Thru&quot; by LotsOfS - A race dedicated to the Voodoo&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Steeplechase&quot; by LotsOfS - A race dedicated to the Pony&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Super Fleischbergcopysr; Autos&quot; by S. - See below for more information&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Who Took my Walton&quot; by Gang&#x0A;&#x0A;UPDATED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Down 1 (Los Santos)&quot; renamed from &quot;[R] Going-Down1 (Los Santos)&quot;.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Down 6 (Bone County)&quot; enabled respawn, renamed from &quot;[R] Going-Down6 (Bone County)&quot;.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Delivery for Woozie&quot; world ramp at Randolph Industrial Estate now should have collisions for everyone, and is less prone to flipping the car.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;&#x0A;- Fixes to the ASS resource by the almighty Joshimuz. It should now throw way less errors for improved stability.&#x0A;&#x0A;SUPER FLEISCHBERG AUTOS:&#x0A;Hi guys, LotsOfS here: Thanks for attending my birthday party! :rpar; Whether you are here to complete the full thing, or just hang out for a little while and only deliver a few, I hope you will all enjoy the race and have a good time. The race will last for 24 hours, or until everyone has finished. Progress is autosaved upon disconnect and will be restored after watching the intro cutscene again after reconnecting, so feel free to leave, take a break, and then come back at any time within those 24 hours. If you were wondering what has changed about the map since last time:&#x0A;- Fixed the BF-400 spawning incorrectly if it was the first vehicle chosen. Its spawn has been raised into the air slightly just to be doubly sure.&#x0A;- Fixed a critical bug where dying would sometimes randomly complete delivery of the vehicle, especially with a lot of players present&#x0A;- The leaderboards work again and properly separate boards by chosen quantity.&#x0A;- The race progress bar will now show a length of 212 decameter instead of 312, making it easier to interpet (1 car = 1dam).&#x0A;- Slightly adjusted the Squalo spawn so driving it out is easier without getting stuck on stuff. &#x0A;- Fix a bug where boats would sometimes teleport onto the hook instead of the hook being lowered towards the boat.&#x0A;- Overtime of the map has been set to equal its duration. This may get lowered in the future, but for now everyone gets 24 hours to finish!&#x0A;- The pile of rubble looks more significant and is visible from further away&#x0A;- It should now be slightly easier to avoid destruction of &apos;the big three&apos; near the delivery point.&#x0A;- The secondary crane will no longer drop planes to their death in the parking lot. It will lower them gently now!&#x0A;- Vehicle model ID is displain in the bottom left upon spawning, as well as on the scoreboard/player menu.&#x0A;- The scoreboard/player menu also shows earned cash from deliveries, based on the monetary value of each vehicle and is affected by vehicle damage. This is merely a fun statistic or secondary goal and has no gameplay effect.&#x0A;- Cranes received a massive behind the scenes overhaul in general and should break much less often than they used to. In case one still does: You can simply reconnect to the server to fix the cranes and your progress will be restored after watching the intro cutscene again. Do not disconnect a second time before the cutscene has ended, this may cause your progress to be erased!&#x0A;Thanks, and have fun!&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~03/04/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Slightly smaller update today - smoothing out some things, couple of new maps, but the news everyone really cares about, loads of new hidden packages! That&apos;ll keep you all busy for the next month or so. Oh, and there might be a nice little addition to races - read below for more information!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going-Down1 (Los Santos)&quot; by Herman-Hedning - A map from the MTA:Race days, slightly patched up to not have gaps between pickups by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going-Down6 (Bone County)&quot; by Hedning - A map from the MTA:Race days, slightly patched up to not have gaps between pickups by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Race, Reroll Edition&quot; by WordofWind - A randomizer race with a twist! Press right-click to reroll your vehicle up to 3 times per race!&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tangerine County Choppers&quot; by S. - A rebranded map from the MTA:Race days, some sloppy kinks were ironed out and the map has been made easier in order to blow that fresh 2024 life into this map.&#x0A;&#x0A;UPDATED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Back To The Future: Kuruma Race&quot; car handling adjusted (different traction, lower center of mass to the car)&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Cave Escape&quot; time limit upped to 30 minutes.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Coin Toss Journey&quot; had overtime increased to 120 seconds.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Fall and Die 2&quot; time limit upped to 30 minutes.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Neon Dreams&quot; (for real this time) now has the music paused by default.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Racing through SF with Uranus&quot; has had some checkpoints altered, as well as a major change to the ending to make it more obvious where to finish.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Solid Poles&quot; has had its ending reworked to no longer feature an RNG big drop that wasn&apos;t in the spirit of the race. &#x0A;- &quot;[R] Woozie&apos;s Jizzy Attack Failure&quot; (for real this time) has had a checkpoint removed around Jizzy&apos;s club so that it is clear sooner which way to turn after crossing under the bridge. The start has also been made easier by moving some of the foodstand objects there out of the way and into spots where they are helpful instead.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] DREI Towers&quot; and &quot;[DD] Speedy Towers&quot; for being too similar to each other. The also-similar &quot;[DD] NEIN Towers&quot; has been kept to represent them.&#x0A;&#x0A;RACE GAMEMODE:&#x0A;- The milisecond separator in the top times leaderboard now also correctly is a period instead of a colon.&#x0A;- There is now a race minimap display on the left, showing a line of the current track and each player&apos;s position on the track. Press F6 to toggle, hold F6 for settings.&#x0A;&#x0A;HIDDEN PACKAGES:&#x0A;- Corrected two black packages that were assigned to the incorrect map.&#x0A;- Added new hidden packages to the following map regions: Avispa Country Club, Doherty, Easter Basin Docks, Easter Bay Airport, El Castillo del Diablo, Garcia, Hashbury, Ocean Flats, Octane Springs Green Palms, Restricted Area, South Bone County, The Panopticon, Verdant Meadows.&#x0A;- Added new black hidden packages to suitable [R] maps starting with the letters H through N. &#x0A;&#x0A;~~~28/03/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Well, we&apos;re keeping up a consistent update schedule of every few days or so. Every time I think new content will slow down, I am proven wrong :D Plenty of new maps, including some Destruction Derby&apos;s! Which is fantastic because it&apos;s been a long time since any new Destruction Derby&apos;s, I hope they are enjoyed! Also S fixed some other stuff. That&apos;s nice of him. Good guy S. We love him. Anyway, detailed changes below:&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Annoying Crane of Absolute Doom&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Call of the Toilet&quot; by WordOfWind&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Back To The Future: Kuruma Race&quot; by misterfolg, replacing &quot;[R] Kuruma Race&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Back To The Future: Kuruma Race 2&quot; by misterfolg, replacing  &quot;[R] Kuruma Race 2&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Cheetah &apos;01 Race&quot; by misterfolg, replacing &quot;[R] Liberty Cheetah &apos;01 Race&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Stunt Drag Los Santos&quot; by BizzyAir&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Stunt Drag San Fierro&quot; by BizzyAir&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Stunt Drag Las Venturas&quot; by BizzyAir&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] BEYBLADOPHRENIA II&quot; by Yuri ft.

The start has also been made easier by moving some of the foodstand objects there out of the way and into spots where they are helpful instead.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Olympic-Jump&quot; now has a fixed 60 second time after first finish.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Olympic-Jump 2&quot; now has a fixed 60 second time after first finish.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] PingPong2.5&quot; now has a fixed 60 second time after first finish.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] The Heist&quot; intro cutscene fixed by changing its countdown duration back to the old standard of 6 (was 3, as per a recent MTA race resource update).&#x0A;- &quot;[R] CC24 - Buccaneer Bay&quot; has had some visuals modified in the cave section and made the boat slightly more passable.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] I Know What I&apos;m Doing 1 - A Horse With No Name&quot; has had random foliage removed and now indicates vehicles changes by checkpoint colour.&#x0A;&#x0A;HIDDEN PACKAGES:&#x0A;- Fixed a bug where black hidden packages would be visible floating in the air/above the water (but not grabbable) at all times even when not on their corresponding map.&#x0A;- Fixed the collection status of 14 specific black hidden packages not being saved when quiting the game.&#x0A;- Fixed a black package that poked out through the ground, causing it to be picked up by anyone who just happened to drive near it. Its collection status has been reset for all players.&#x0A;&#x0A;RACE GAMEMODE:&#x0A;- Ghosts of your personal bests are now stored locally on your own machine. This will lessen the load on the server and speed up map transition times when a lot of players are present. If you&apos;re worried about disk space: Ghosts are stored in &quot;&lt;Multi Theft Auto Installation Directory&gt;\mods\deathmatch\resources\race_ghost\ghosts&quot; and their filesize is about 1 kilobyte per second of recording, or 1 megabyte per 17 minutes. If no local copy is found (eg. after a reformat), it will fetch a backup ghost from the server and store that on the local machine for future use.&#x0A;- Fix a bug where top time holders would see their Top ghost alongside a fake PB ghost&#x0A;- Times are now correctly formatted, using a period instead of a colon to separate centiseconds from seconds.&#x0A;- Map creators: You can now set a fixed overtime duration for your map by adding a &apos;#timeafterfirstfinish&apos; setting to the meta.xml and setting it to an integer (in seconds). This setting is recommended for maps that can have wildly varying finish times with a very short top time, Eg. maps like &quot;[R] Olympic Jump&quot; or &quot;[R] Chase The Checkpoint&quot;.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~23/03/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Some map changes and a couple new maps and also PB ghosts I&apos;m rushing this cause I forgot it okay thanks byeeeeeeee&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Beyond Back o Beyond and Back to Back o Beyond&quot; by LotsOfS&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Delivery for Woozie&quot; by LotsOfS&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Snake Farm&quot; threw an error at server boot, preventing it from being loaded. The bug has been fixed and the map is now back in the pool.&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Airpain 3&quot; vehicles now have better handling. The plane swoop sequence has been improved. Dodos are now revealed on the map after 3:30 (was 4:00), or when someone finishes. Dodo explosions are less likely to throw your car around. Removed stutter when destroying Dodos, and reduced the chances of it clipping you into the ground.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Old School Map&quot; now has music that can be turned on by pressing M, because an error in the code that prevented it from being enabled has been fixed.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Taking Off With The Trash&quot; has had some minor alterations around the second dumpster pickup area to make it more sightreadable. Removed some more world dumpsters for immersion.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Visit Dad&quot; has been truncated from 73 to 51 checkpoints, removing the uphill parts after Dillimore where you return to the starting mansion.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] CC24 - Kot Temple&quot; has been renamed to &quot;[R] CC24 - Temple of the Kots&quot;, and has had some sections re-made, such as the middle section and the shortcut.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Docki The Cow Drag&quot; has had cow sizes adjusted.&#x0A;&#x0A;RACE GAMEMODE:&#x0A;- Spectate STILL chose the last player in the race, despite the update on 15/03/2024. Now it should truly pick someone at random.&#x0A;- It will now record and show your PB ghost alongside the Top Time ghost. Note that this does not work retroactively, as non 1st place runs before today had no ghosts recorded of them.&#x0A;- When there are not a lot of players on the server, additional ghosts may appear to make the race look more lively.&#x0A;- The race ghost script also received various upgrades coming from the official Multi Theft Auto team&apos;s side. No clue what they are exactly. It&apos;s mostly behind the scenes stuff.&#x0A;- The grid countdown has been lowered to 3 seconds (was 6, though ticks 4-6 were silent and had no graphic)&#x0A;- Map creators: You can now adjust the grid countdown duration for your map by adding a &apos;#countdownduration&apos; setting to the meta.xml and setting it to an integer 0-65535 (in seconds). However, there is not much reason to change this from the default of 3; the only map on this server that currently uses it is &quot;[MG] Airpain 3&quot; which plays a 6 second physics based sequence during the grid countdown. &#x0A;&#x0A;HIDDEN PACKAGES:&#x0A;- Black hidden packages are now visible on maps that take place far outside the regular SA world.&#x0A;- Collected black hidden packages no longer respawn when restarting a map.&#x0A;- Removed several black packages that were too unhidden.&#x0A;- Added new black hidden packages to suitable race maps starting with the letters E-G, as well as a few extra ones on previously packagified maps.&#x0A;- Fixed some broken black hidden packages that were either attributed to the wrong map, or had a typo in their coordinates.&#x0A;- Fixed a bug where progress would go unsaved when using /logout.&#x0A;- Fixed black packages not appearing correctly or at all when joining or logging in while the map is already in progress.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~19/03/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Big update today! We&apos;ve got new maps up the wazoo, fixes, improvements, new hidden packages, everything anyone could ever want! Hope this&apos;ll keep all you entertained for a bit! :D&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] A Shipment for the Vagos&quot; by LotsOfS&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Burning Vehicles Reported&quot; by LotsOfS&#x0A;- &quot;[R] CC24 - Buccaneer Bay&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] CC24 - Kot Temple&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Coast Guard&quot; by Twohu ft.

These can only be found on custom maps that take place on all new terrain. The following maps are supported so far:&#x0A;- All suitable [DD] maps&#x0A;- All suitable [MG] maps&#x0A;- All suitable [R] maps whose (file)names begin with a number or the letters A through D&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~15/03/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;So while the last update was, in my opinion, totally perfect - some people suggested there may have been some problems. Such as, uh, everything being broken. So we&apos;re addressing that here.&#x0A;&#x0A;- Fixed spectate mode constantly spectating nobody despite there being available players.&#x0A;- Fixed overtime not being set correctly.&#x0A;- Fixed ASS not hiding players properly on /hide 1.&#x0A;- Updated deprecated variables in the race gamemode (left over from the incredibly old versions we updated from.)&#x0A;- Fixed the Rs (respawn time) label not being set correctly.&#x0A;- Fixed maps with no descriptions saying &apos;Text&apos; on the loading screen.&#x0A;- Fixed the server failing to trigger map start events, which broke most of the things that were broken.&#x0A;- Possibly fixed the race progress bar not updating correctly? Or at least breaking less often.&#x0A;- Fixed the speedometer being missing even when enabled.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~13/03/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Various new maps, fixes, and old stuff from two years ago being implemented.&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Liberty Cheetah 01 Race&quot; by misterfolg&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Hold W Randomiser&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] The Mines of Moria&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] NEO SPUGTOPIA&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Paramedic&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Paramedic - San Andreas&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Shanty 8-Track Randomiser&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Shanty 8-Track Randomiser (Collisions)&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tumbleweed&quot; by Mawfeen&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Just Business&quot; for largely self-explanatory reasons.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Dubstruction Derby&quot; cause it&apos;s bad.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- New Hidden Packages region added!&#x0A;- Extra map information will now be displayed during loading screens.&#x0A;- Entering spectate mode will now spectate a random player rather than always consistently being the player in last place.&#x0A;- Various optimisations and upgrades to the race gamemode.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~10/03/2024 Update~~~&#x0A;Welcome back to the official GTA Speedrunners&apos; Server! It&apos;s back...again! Now running on a new dedicated server and sponsored by Joshimuz and his generosity, so everyone is required to worship him forever and always. Everything should be exactly how you remember it - nothing much else to say really. Revel in the nostalgia, and as always you can suggest new things in #mta-general on The123robot Discord or with the /report system. New things will be added as long as people want to develop for it, and new maps will keep being added as long as you guys keeping making them, but the server itself should keep running for a long long time to come.&#x0A;&#x0A;14 new maps have been added courtesty of misterfolg - no doubt they will all be future classics. &#x0A;&#x0A;~~~21/03/2022 Update~~~&#x0A;Quick small update for minor additions and improvements.&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tug Team Racing 4&quot; by Ross&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Last Tug Standing&quot; by Ross&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] The Most Random Race of Them All&quot; cause it turned out to be a lot more boring than it sounds. I can see a version of this with more variety and less straight lines that could be interesting if someone put the work in.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- New Hidden Packages region added!&#x0A;- /votekick has been re-enabled after fixes, along with /votekill&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~15/03/2022 Update~~~&#x0A;Woah the server is back hype. After a hiatus that was supposed to be short but turned into 5 months but now it&apos;s back. At least that means the server gets extra hype, I guess :P Anyway, everything&apos;s the same as before, come to me if there are any problems, etc etc. Here&apos;s a list of new maps:&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- [R] Turismo Travel by KatastrofaS&#x0A;- [R] Going Down 3 (Freeway Intersections) by Hedning&#x0A;- [R] Taxi Drver by Jonde&#x0A;- [R] Los Santos Roofs by Ajuh&#x0A;- [R] LV Tour by Ajuh&#x0A;- [R] The Vortex Club by Jivel1&#x0A;- [R] Vance Landscaping 1 by Jivel1&#x0A;- Another collection of 40 racing maps by Waldek for you to grind, identifiable by their NC2021 prefix.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~04/03/2021 Update~~~&#x0A;Hey, so you guys have been sending in loads of maps, so even though I&apos;ve not had too much time to work on other aspects of the server, I wanted to make sure I added the new content, give you all some new stuff to enjoy!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Underwater Race&quot; by GamingMaster&#x0A;- &quot;[R] BIGHAM&quot; by The_Ghost&#x0A;- A collection of 10 racing maps by Walkek, identifiable by the NC2021-50 prefix. &#x0A;- &quot;[R] HYPERHAM&quot; by The_Ghost&#x0A;- Re-added &quot;[R] The Heist&quot; by Ali_Digitali. This is the only one of his removed maps deemed to be stable enough for re-addition. His other ones most definitely are not.&#x0A;&#x0A;Couple other minor map fixes that aren&apos;t worth mentioning, and that&apos;s literally it. But that&apos;s like, 15 new maps so, enjoy those!&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~07/02/2021 Update~~~&#x0A;First update of 2021, look at that! Mostly new maps, couple of quality of life improvements as well.&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sanchez Playground&quot; by RiDGE.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Gant And Garver&quot; by S. and Gang&#x0A;- &quot;[R] 8Lap Wallride&quot; by Ransom&#x0A;- &quot;[R] You Decide What To Drive&quot; 1, 2, and 3, a trilogy of maps by The_Ghost&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sultans Of Swingers&quot; by Jivel1&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Streetside Flashing&quot; by Jivel1&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Rooftop Ragequit&quot; by Jivel1. This was previously on the server but removed due to a particular aspect of the map that has been changed. We&apos;ll see if people take to it more now. :P&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Racing Through The Wilderness&quot; removed due to abysmally low ratings and feedback.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- There is now a half second grace period from when everyone is spectating to the map ending, allowing players on their own to make use of the spectate respawn without instantly ending the map.&#x0A;- More Hidden Packages added in Valle Occultado, Arco Del Oeste, Easter Bay, Juniper Hill, Central and South Tierra Robada, Esplande East, Financial, and Calton Heights. To those eager hunters who found all the existing packages, get back to it! :P&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~26/12/2020 Update~~~&#x0A;So I wasn&apos;t planning on another update this soon, but there were a couple bugs that required urgent fixing. Plus I got sent in some new maps by some lovely people and I&apos;d feel bad not getting them up quick. :P So another surprise update before 2020 ends - such a surprise it even surprised me! When you think about it, this has been a pretty solid year for the server, especially considering it wasn&apos;t even running at the start of it. :D A lot of progress has been had over that time, and I&apos;m satisfied with that. But yeah, enough of that, here&apos;s the important changes:&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Pig Pen Race&quot; by choripanycristi&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Sultan Night&quot; by Ezekah&#x0A;&#x0A;BUG FIXES:&#x0A;- The race ghost will now no longer record vehicle weapon fire, so now you can no longer be murdered from the past.&#x0A;- Set as default for heli blade collisions to be disabled in all maps with ghost mode, so now strictly heli-based maps are properly playable with multiple people.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~21/12/2020 - The Christmas SR Update~~~&#x0A;Merry Christmas, everyone! Hope you&apos;re having lovely jolly holidays and all of that. In celebration of the occasion, I&apos;ve been working hard to push out a big Christmas update for you guys, and here it is! Managed to get it in before Christmas actually happened at least. Other than minor fixes, this update is just a whole load of SR maps - I remembered that this is a Speedrunner Server and decided there should be more SR-based content. :P So there&apos;s loads of that, and also another special surprise map! But yeah, this update took a lot of work from me, making sure all of the SR maps were accurate and true to their singleplayer counterparts, so don&apos;t expect another update for quite a while. But you know, you&apos;ve got like 30 new maps to grind for times on, so have fun with that. :D&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- Every single street and air race from singleplayer has been ported to the server so you can compete against each other in them live! That&apos;s 23 in total. I feel it&apos;s a bit pointless to list them all out, so you can Google a list if you don&apos;t remember them. :P Porting all of them accurately took ages by the way, so you guys better appreciate it!&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Lure&quot; ported by 123robot. Everyone&apos;s favourite mission, now playable with your friends!&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Monster&quot; ported by 123robot&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] N.O.E.&quot; ported by 123robot&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Randomizer Race 3&quot; by 123robot, the big last surprise gift! For those who aren&apos;t so interested in the serious racing and more the wacky maps, there&apos;s another one for you!&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Just Business&quot; now has respawns disabled to prevent an exploit that broke the scripting. Top times that used this have been removed.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Love A Rainy Map&quot;. Turns out no one loved it after all.&#x0A;- A duplicate of &quot;[R] Rally_Italy_SS1&quot; that had somehow been in the map pool without anyone noticing for ages. Where players have better times on the duplicate map, they have been moved to the other one.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- The F9 Help Menu now explains the race prefixes in the votemanager section. Now if anyone asks, tell them to press F9. Teach to fish!&#x0A;- Hidden Package help has been updated with the new areas containing packages.&#x0A;- New PBs are now displayed more generously, especially if fewer players are online.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 03/12/2020 Update~~~&#x0A;Don&apos;t get too excited - this isn&apos;t really a full update, more an improvement of a specific series of map. That&apos;s right, the esteemed Tug Team RacingTM series, beloved by all. Quick summary of what&apos;s changed below:&#x0A;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tug Team Racing 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot; has been split into two maps, as the second, more challening part of the map was considered too jarring to be combined with the rest of it. The first half of the map is now &quot;[R] Tug Team Racing 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot; and the challenge section of the map is now split into &quot;[R] Tug Team Racing 2.5: Extra Stage&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tug Team Racing 3&quot; has been added, yet another installment in the acclaimed series. Enjoy!&#x0A;&#x0A;While this update does not include any further changes, I can assure you that more maps, fixes, and other improvements are being worked on as we speak, so more updates are to come!&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 02/12/2020 Update~~~&#x0A;In recognition of some renewed interest in the server thanks to the POWER OF LIVE STREAMS, we&apos;ve been working on several changes, improvements and fixes for the server, as well as new maps, some of which are still in the works and will come in future updates, however there&apos;s still a lot new to enjoy here. With many thanks to S. for his assistance with several of these changes:&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Up 2&quot; by S. &amp; Gang&#x0A;- &quot;[R] U&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Blazing Chandelle - Stage 3&quot; by Ross&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tug Team Racing 2: Electric Boogaloo&quot; by Ross&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Airport Construction&quot; by Gang&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Congested Slopes&quot; by Jonza&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Stunt City&quot; by R3D4NG3L&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Highway Drift&quot; by Destroyer-GT&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Ridin&apos; Around Angel Pine&quot; by Samy&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Shooting Through SF&quot; by AdnanKananda&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Vagos Drive&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Fatal Freeway&quot; by KRraAaSH&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Onwards and Upwards&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Precarious Pathway&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Deadline&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Dinghy Race?&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Down 2 (Ocean Docks)&quot; by Herman-Hedning&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Down 5 (Easter Bay)&quot; by Herman-Hedning&#x0A;- &quot;[R] SF SPRINT&quot; by BLaCKMaMBa&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Smonster&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Tank Invaded Farm&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Weapon Drop&quot; (this map is now finally playable after several attempts to add it in the past)&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Low Stakes, High Bike&quot; by Nasho&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Up 1&quot; has had several changes to make the race experience easier and more natural, as well as making it look a bit nicer.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Big Loop&quot; has been slightly modified to make the loop easier to complete properly.&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Musical Garages&quot; has had a bug fixed that caused the number of garages not to correctly decrease with the players.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] PingPong2.5&quot; now has the ability to respawn destroyed mines.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] HotringRaceTrack&quot; has had its repsawn time reduced.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Mountain Course&quot; now no longer allows other players to break the wooden paths you need to progress through the race.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Wu Zi Mu&quot; and &quot;[R] Farewell, My Love...&quot; are now much more accurate to their singleplayer counterparts. The sizes of checkpoints have been increased to more closely match singleplayer hitboxes, everybody now spawns where you would in singleplayer, and the ZR-350 in &quot;[R] Farewell, My Love...&quot; uses offroad wheels as in singleplayer.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Snake Farm&quot; now displays a clear warning when you are losing health from not moving.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Die Another Day&quot; uses improved text drawing code and takes away health when far away from other players as in the Infernus Showdown maps.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Liberty City Run-around&quot; now features collision over the entire city rather than only some parts, so it is now highly unlikely you will fall through somewhere you don&apos;t expect. It also now plays voice lines upon completion.&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Import/Export Race&quot; now allows you to view the full experience leaderboard as well as the shortened leaderboard with F5.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Chase the Checkpoint&quot; has less unnecessary chat output.&#x0A;The most heavily modified maps have had their ratings and times reset where the changes are too great for the stats of the original map to reflect its new state.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Hot Package: The First 2018&quot; for being broken and a bit rubbish. The general concept of a trucking race could be good with improvements in the future though.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- More hidden packages have been added to find in Tierra Robada and northern areas of San Fierro. If you had already found the existing packages, there&apos;s now more out there to discover!&#x0A;- Car colours can now generate more random values, allowing for more variety and helping your car pop out more from others.&#x0A;- Fixed the MOTD so that it displays at a smaller size for lower resolutions.&#x0A;- Obtaining a top time now informs you of your time save over your PB as well.&#x0A;- Many improvements and changes to the voting system. Maps can now be matched by their internal name so all maps can be voted for. Voting threshold for /voteredo and /votemap have been increased so that a larger majority is  required for success. /votemap [name] now sets the map being voted for as being the next map rather than instantly switching.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~03/07/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Been a little bit since the last update, eh? A lot of this stuff has been in the pipeline for a while, but now the update&apos;s finally coming to the server! This mostly focuses on general quality of life improvements and fixes to the server - not too much in the way of new maps. Still, hope you enjoy the additions! Huge thanks to Ali_Digitali, who is the main one to thank for a lot of these changes!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Snake Farm&quot; by Ali_Digitali&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Solid Poles&quot; by Gang and S.&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Tears of the Dragon&quot; now saves the longest survival times to the scoreboard.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Tower Game 1&quot; now has a map limit so that players can no longer fly endlessly out of bounds.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Hold the Line&quot; now has further improved checkpoint collisions.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] A Wise Man from the East&quot; fixes the issue that caused players to occasionally fall through the floor.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Disco Drive&quot; has decreased chances of disco cars, and added traffic lights at the beginning.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Catapult!&quot; has been modified to try to improve balance - catapults now have landing safety nets and they have a 200HP benefit.&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] NRG-500&quot; now has increased sizes for checkpoint hitboxes.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Hold the Line: Night Ring&quot; is more generally stable and uses a more dynamic colour system.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Disco Dash&quot; has more colour variation, and no more flashing buildings.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- The author of the current map is now displayed in the bottom left info panel.&#x0A;- The /2048 minigame now has a moveable window and an additional WASD control scheme.&#x0A;- Your personal best time is now displayed in the scoreboard if it&apos;s not in the top 10.&#x0A;- Top times are now outputted to the chat.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~05/05/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Happy May the 5th everyone! Here&apos;s your now monthly update, I guess - server isn&apos;t as maintenance-demanding as it was in the launch month but that doesn&apos;t mean there isn&apos;t still cool new stuff to enjoy! :D&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Noob Race&quot; by Dubgame + S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Baggy Baggage&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Cool Chainsaw&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] S.&apos; Roof Jumps&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Battle Deluxe&quot; by Ali Digitali + Mintse&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Disco Dancing&quot; by Ali Digitali + Kreedon&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Just Business&quot; by Ali Digitali&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Airport Tour&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Around SF 1&quot; and &quot;[R] Around SF 2&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Buffalo Sheriff&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Cuda&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Emperor of the Hills&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Fast Truck&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Mini LS&quot; by |CrF|Alan&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] The Most Random Race of Them All&quot; has had certain changes reverted that made the map more likely to generate in an unplayable state.&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Air Pain 3&quot; now reveals the location of remaining Dodo&apos;s on the map after 4 minutes instead of 5.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- Removed &quot;[MG] There Can Only Be One&quot; since it did not function as intended.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- A big new feature has been added as another way of keeping yourself occupied during maps you&apos;re not interested in playing. S. has created an add-on for coloured hidden packages that you can find and collect. Press F9 for more information on how it works and the relevant commands. At the moment, packages are only present in the north-western corner of the map, but it may be expanded in the future. Enjoy your searching!&#x0A;- Corrected how colour codes are displayed during races.&#x0A;- Added a spectate counter showing how many people are currently spectating you or someone else.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~06/04/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; It&apos;s been a while, but here&apos;s a big ol&apos; update to hopefully make up for it! This is dedicated to LotsOfS, whose birthday it is on the day of this update, so a very happy birthday to him! :D&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Going Up 1&quot; by Gang and S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Dumper Madness Reloaded&quot; by Oekeokiki and Gang&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] 555 WE Tip&quot; by S.

As you can see above, due to recent incidents, I&apos;ve added basic guidelines for what is and is not considered acceptable behaviour on the server. As I say there, please /report anyone who is consistently failing to follow them. They may be edited over time so keep yourself familiar with them. Otherwise, here are the exciting changes!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;&#x0A;&quot;[R] Like a Flash&quot; by Samy&#x0A;&quot;[TW] Driving School Teamwork by S.&quot; by S.&#x0A;&#x0A;A big batch of old maps that I decided were suitable were edited and re-added:&#x0A;&#x0A;&quot;[R] BOR-KDC 040318 Buffalo&quot; by [SGA]morpp&#x0A;&quot;[R] BOR-KDC 040318 SuperGT&quot; by [SGA]morpp&#x0A;&quot;[R] BOR-KDC 040318 Turismo&quot; by [SGA]morpp&#x0A;&quot;[MG] Blood Harvest&quot; by Ali_Digitali&#x0A;&quot;[R] Hover Drop&quot; by Joshimuz&#x0A;&quot;[R] Get Back to the Grove&quot; by A_QUEEN&#x0A;&quot;[R] Sky High&quot; by Blue Zircon&#x0A;&quot;[R] Spinner Vortex&quot; by Unknown&#x0A;&quot;[R] The Most Random Race of Them All&quot; by Ali_Digitali with Edits by 123robot&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Mind the Gap&quot; - improved ending and the square circle drive.&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Musical Garages&quot; - fixed number of garages logic, fixed gettting stuck in ramps, more ramps added, monster pickup removed, music volume increased, music stopped correctly after death, fixed two people spawning in one garage, improved garage collision, added second wall for larger numbers of players, prevented the exploit that allowed you to explode the map.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] End of the Smokio&quot; - race markers rearranged, some unnecessary obstacles and spawn points removed&#x0A;- &quot;[R] GP Los Santos | GT1 | Race&quot; - increased back up to 5 laps, modified fuel consumption, improved refuelling explanation. Will see what people think of that, maybe eventually I&apos;ll finally get it right. :P&#x0A;- &quot;[TW] Verona Pier Teamwork by S.&quot; - fixed collision issues, fixed tutorial.&#x0A;- &quot;[DD] Looney Toons&quot; - added more spawns to support 64 players&#x0A;- &quot;[R] PingPong2.5&quot; - added more mines to hopefully prevent the issue where they all break.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;&#x0A;- Vehicle respawning improved to save your nitro and nitro level.&#x0A;- Bottom right corner text improved to be more visible.&#x0A;- Improved the &quot;Reports&quot; system (which was previously there, just not advertised). You should use that to report players, broken maps or features, or to give new feature ideas.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~23/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Welcome to another fairly minor update yeah!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Emergency Landing&quot; by S.

Noire&quot;&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- Further improvements to the antiBlow script.&#x0A;&#x0A;There are lots more maps being worked on in the background by various people, so anticipate some cool new maps fairly soon!&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~21/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Hello, welcome to another update. I&apos;m sure a million broken things will immediately be found but please remember we also fixed a bunch of other things too and didn&apos;t just make an update to break everything for you. Also special thanks to Jivel1 and SpeedyFolf for helping test this update - they were a great help!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] GP Los Santos | GT1 | Race&quot; by Vally with edits by Wuzi, 123robot, and S.&#x0A;- &quot;[R] L.S. Noire&quot; by Hoxi&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Farewell, My Love...&quot; by Talidan&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Real Driving School&quot; is now named &quot;[SR] City Slicking&quot;&#x0A;- Even more fixes to &quot;[TW] Verona Pier Teamwork by S.&quot;&#x0A;- Fixed several maps that were improperly set to development mode.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Los Bullet&quot;&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Emergency Landing&quot; - Will be re-added once fixes are implemented.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- Fixed the broken race timer.&#x0A;- Fixes to the FPS and Ping display.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~19/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A;Another update because people are doing too many cool fixes and making too many cool maps. How dare you guys make things!&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Blazing Chandelle - Stage 1&quot; by Ross&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Faggio Fierro&quot; by Trevortjes&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] The Green Sabre&quot; by Yumitsu&#x0A;- &quot;[R] The Blista Club&quot; by Trevortjes&#x0A;- &quot;[SR] Los Sepulcros&quot; by Hoxi&#x0A;- &quot;[R] The Slamvan Club&quot; by Trevortjes&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Shades Only BabyRage&quot; by Terrtail&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Emergency Landing&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;[MG] Musical Garages&quot; by Mowemax&#x0A;- &quot;[R] Easier NRG Map&quot; by Terrtail (replacing Easy NRG Map)&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- &quot;Verona Pier Teamwork (BY S. BY THE WAY)&quot; has had several fixes and improvements that are too much to list  herebut I assure you they&apos;re all good.&#x0A;- &quot;There Can Be Only One&quot; has been improved so it hopefully works properly now. Big emphasis on hopefully.&#x0A;- &quot;Hot Package: The First 2018&quot; has been changed to fix the bug where it respawns you in spectate.&#x0A;- &quot;Infernus Showdown: SF Airport&quot; has removed the exploit where you could hide on the docks.&#x0A;- &quot;Tears of the Dragon&quot; has been changed to fix the bug where you get set on fire forever.&#x0A;- &quot;Randomizer Oval Race&quot; has fixed you occasionally spawning in the floor.&#x0A;- &quot;Hard With Style&quot; now uses Ghost Mode. BY THE WAY USE GHOST MODE IN YOUR MAPS.&#x0A;- Corrected the categorisation for some maps.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;Weapon Drop&quot; because IT REFUSES TO WORK.&#x0A;- &quot;Rooftop Ragequit&quot; until an improved version is prepared.&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- AFK script received several improvements. Now it works properly, and flashes big text in your face so you can&apos;t miss it. :P&#x0A;- Anti-Blow script to try and help prevent chain explosions.&#x0A;- Added various extra details in the bottom left corner (ping, FPS, map).&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~16/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Another big update! Wow woah magical.&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;Catalina Quadrilogy&quot; by Lordmau5&#x0A;- &quot;There Can Only Be One&quot; by Joshimuz&#x0A;- &quot;Import/Export Race&quot; by S.&#x0A;- &quot;Hard with Style&quot; by Mateoryt&#x0A;- &quot;Heinz Faust Racing&quot; by S. (re-added with major improvements)&#x0A;- &quot;Racing With The Supastuka&quot; by S.&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- All maps based on in-game speedrun routes now have their own prefix - [SR]. This helps distinguish them from ordinary races for people who prefer one or the other, and also removes the need to figure out the exact speedrun category of a map.&#x0A;- Robbing Uncle Sam and Weapon Drop should finally work properly now. If they don&apos;t I&apos;ll be very upset.&#x0A;- Car Game DD now ends with a hunter instead of a Rhino. Also fixed issues with fake blips.&#x0A;- Liberty City Run-Around has been updated to use more accurate collisions. Some checkpoints have also been modified and a kill plane was added under the city.&#x0A;&#x0A;REMOVED MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;555 We Refuse to Reset&quot;  &quot;Badlands (mission)&quot; (more inaccurate speedrun-type maps that need improving)&#x0A;- &quot;Newton&apos;s Cradle&quot;&#x0A;&#x0A;RESOURCES:&#x0A;- Finally added an auto-AFK system! Anyone AFK for about 15 seconds or longer will now automatically go into spectate mode.&#x0A;- Additionally, players in spectate mode will now no longer hold up the map vote.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~14/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; This update is mostly concentrated on fixing stuff, mostly in maps but also some resources. You could also say this MOTD itself is updated because now it&apos;s a proper changelog. Ooh fancy.&#x0A;&#x0A;NEW MAPS:&#x0A;- &quot;Haytona Endurance&quot;  &quot;Haytona Hotring&quot; by Uguu (these two maps replace the original Haytona)&#x0A;- &quot;Porsche Cup&quot; by Trevortjes&#x0A;- &quot;Any% - Robbing Uncle Sam&quot; by yumitsu&#x0A;- &quot;Disco Derby 3D&quot; by Ali_Digitali (technically not new but re-added to map pool after fixes)&#x0A;&#x0A;MAP EDITS:&#x0A;- All maps with overly long respawn times have now been reduced to 1 second respawn!&#x0A;- Infernus Showdowns (health drains when far from players, text rendering improved)&#x0A;- Pirates of San Andreas (uses big red text like Infernus Showdowns)&#x0A;- Hold the Line (marker placements improved, respawn velocity fixed)&#x0A;- 3-Bit-Hit: Desert (removed SF spawn)&#x0A;- Hotring Race Track (removed unnecessary extra laps)&#x0A;- Top of the Pyramid (now version 3, hopefully it&apos;s a bit better)&#x0A;- Move!

Four brand new server resources have been added - an improved Anti-Social Simulator, a GUI minigame (use /2048), private messages, and time played on the scoreboard. Updated the help manager. Added new maps from S., Uguu, Joshimuz, and WordOfWind. Removed some maps that didn&apos;t work or were breaking the server (LOOKING AT YOU ALI). Updated some maps with improvements.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~10/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Added 3 new maps provided by WordofWind, Terrtail, and Yoka. Sort of balancing that out is the removal of 3 maps that were causing server issues or need updating. A couple other maps were also updated for fixes.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~05/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Map pool increased to 224 with the re-addition of all the old maps Joshimuz found plus 4 brand new ones by LateLJ, Trevortjes, and Jivel1. Also updated 5 existing maps.&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 01/03/2020 Update~~~&#x0A; Server is back (again!) under new management! It is now being hosted by 123robot and should be in no danger of going down for the foreseeable future, even if nobody plays on it. :P Him and Parik will be mainly responsible for maintaining it, so probably bug them if you have issues instead of Joshimuz, as he is a very important speedrunner man with no time for silly MTA servers! Other than that, almost everything should be how you remember it if you played it before, so enjoy!&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 03/04/2018 Update ~~~&#x0A;Map pool increased to 162, removed 5 more low rated maps: The-True-Olympic-Jump (3.07), Sky High (3.81), Spinner Vortex (3.97), CraRyzaze (4.43) and Hover Drop (4.71).&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 11/03/2018 Update ~~~&#x0A;Map pool increased to 158, removed 5 more low rated maps: CW-BOR-KDC-040318-Turismo (1.8), CW-BOR-KDC-040318-SuperGT (2.67), Blood Harvest (2.8), CW-BOR-KDC-040318-Buffalo (3.44), Randomizer (the &quot;fake&quot; one, 4.65).&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 05/03/2018 Update ~~~&#x0A;We had 105 maps, and 100 maps seems like a decent amount so I removed 5 low rated maps: Airport and Back (2.3), Get Back to The Grove (3.2), HydraEscape (3.5), Monster Madness (3.6) and Beverly&apos;s Funneral (4.5)&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 13/02/2018 Update ~~~&#x0A;Since the 6 days the server has been up again a lot of new (and old) maps have been added. Also there is a brand new voting system. I&apos;m working on adding a carhide script (all the pre-existing ones will break non-ghostmode maps and the DDs and are not open source so I can&apos;t fix them) however this will probably have to wait until after ESA (I&apos;m gone from 17-25).&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 07/02/2018 Update ~~~&#x0A;Wow, that was a long hiatus. After over 4 years this server makes it&apos;s glorious return. I&apos;m currently testing this to see if people are interested again (aka server isn&apos;t only used when I stream it).&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 15/12/2013 Update ~~~&#x0A;Remember to use /rate to rate good and bad maps, bad maps will be removed every now and then to keep a good standard of map pool. &quot;/rate 7&quot; means to give a map a 7 out of 10 rating.&#x0A;Press F9 for help using the server&apos;s modes and mods.&#x0A;If you would like your map added to the server, send Joshimuz a PM on twitch.tv &#x0A;A proper way of sending in maps will be made Soon(TM)&#x0A;&#x0A;~~~ 14/12/2013 Update ~~~&#x0A;The play again option in the vote-manager is now limited to 2 times, meaning a map can now only be played 3 times maximum, before playing another map.&#x0A;The amount of choices was also reduced to 5 maps and play again.&#x0A;These changes are to promote playing of other maps, instead of the 6+1 Towers-&gt; Kappa Towers-&gt; Disco Derby -&gt; 6+1 Towers endless cycle that was happening.</motd>
