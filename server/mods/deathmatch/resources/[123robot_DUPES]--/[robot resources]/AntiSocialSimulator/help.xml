<help>Anti Social Simulator (ASS) hides other pesky players from your MultiTheftAuto experience.

To use, enter /hide followed by a number.

"/hide 0" - Turns off ASS - No additional hiding beyond normal transparency will be applied
"/hide 1" - Turns on Distance based ASS - Players will change transparency based on distance
"/hide 2" - Turns on full ASS - Sends every other player to the shadow realm

ASS only works on non-collision requiring Races. Not on Destruction Derbies or (most)Minigames and not on Races that have collision turned on.

ASS will attempt to remember your settings between races, and if you're logged into an account it will remember between play sessions (as long as you remember to log in, even if your nick isn't protected)
