  <info type="map" gamemodes="race" name="6028" author="Mr Marc aka Lylo" description="This map is an Infernus based race and takes you from LS Airport onwards and upwards towards the roof of the tallest building in the city centre. The roads get pretty high pretty quickly and are also very twisty and almost unpredictable. With that in mind and if you can, use your mouse whilst driving to see whats ahead of you. The roads can be pretty unforgiving being completely open with no barriers on the sides to stop you falling, so take care, and good luck!" />
