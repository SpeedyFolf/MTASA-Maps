Strategizer Race

[Introductionary blurb]
This race consists of 10 different tracks. Each player gets a selection of 10 vehicles, which will be the same for each player. 
During the setup phase, which lasts 5 minutes, each player is to assign their 10 vehicles to the 10 tracks. 

[Brief how to]
To assign a vehicle to a track, first select the track using the special control up and down buttons, and select a vehicle using the special control left and right buttons. (Hint: These are the same buttons with which you bounce your low rider vehicle during the Cesar Vialpando mission.)
Then, assign the currently selected vehicle to the currently selected track using the submission key (with which you would start Vigilante, etc.).
