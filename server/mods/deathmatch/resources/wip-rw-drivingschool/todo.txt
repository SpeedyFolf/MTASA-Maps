You can squeeze throug hthe sub_gate and the orange barrier above the Dune area
The gate by the Dune is blocking the DUne's path
The test spawnpoint at the Andromade still exists
move checkpointsi n between the two DFTs maybe a bit further up the ramp?
Extend the diagonal placed walls in the DFT area so you don't get stuck on them.
DFT is escapable perhaps
Add a speedbump to guide helpers towards the yankee as they come off the thing
Improve flow of helper vehicles
checkpoint 26 and 27 can be gotten b ygrinding the wall adn goign back
Add a diagonal wall so you can just reverse the yankee out
Smooth all the sharp edges
Place a repair in the middle of the last DFT's carry path
Fix Super GT falling through its floor
Dumper can get out by driving over the orange fence by the blue pole
Make the zigzaggy bit before Dune a little less obnoxious
